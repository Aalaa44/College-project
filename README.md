Heavy nursing workloads have been shown to negatively impact job satisfaction, leading to high turnover rates and contributing to the ongoing nursing shortage. Moreover, research indicates that excessive workloads can compromise patient safety.
The aim of this project is to alleviate nurses’ workload - particularly during night shifts - by limiting their responsibilities to medication administration and emergency care, while reducing the need for continuous manual patient monitoring.
Using existing datasets from a large population of patients and their recorded vital signs, this project will develop a model capable of continuously assessing each patient’s condition. The model’s assessment will be based on patient-specific data, including demographic information (such as age and gender),and real-time vital signs throughout their hospital stay.
Unlike existing monitoring systems based on fixed thresholds, the proposed model continuously learns from each patient’s demographic and clinical data to provide personalized assessments. It functions as a decision-support tool that helps nurses prioritize care rather than replacing their role. By combining real-time patient analysis with workload trend prediction, the system improves patient safety and supports efficient workforce management.
